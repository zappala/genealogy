Mariano Zappala is my paternal grandfather. He was born in Italy,
immigrated to America when he was 10, then lived in New York and
California. This post summarizes what I know about his life at this
point. I hope some of my relatives can share additional stories,
photos, and documents.

Notes

Mariano was born in `Sersale <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sersale>`__,
Italy, which is in the southern party of Italy, near Catanzaro:

He lived there until he was 11, when he immigrated to
America. Mariano’s father, Carmelo, left for America in 1910, returned
for a short time, then left for good in 1914. During this time, his
wife Lucia stayed in Sersale with her three children, Maria, Mariano,
and Cecilia. While he was gone, Lucia’s sister died and Lucia cared
for her children as well as her own. When it was time for Lucia and
her children to meet Carmelo in Sersale, the parting was very sad, and
the relatives who live there today still tell stories of this day.

Mariano married Anna Sposato in 1938, and they had five children, who
are still living.
